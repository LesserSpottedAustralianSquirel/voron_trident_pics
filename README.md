Hi!

Support file for Voron trident 1.9 as described at https://vorondesign.com/voron_trident

2 files listed below with description

1) trident_stl_pics.zip 
- List of stl small picture files. in the original directory structure
- Used to find the part by matching it from the offical documentation/pdf
- Might look good in documentation 

2) stl_parts_list.txt   
- text list of all stls in their directory structure
- Just the output of find . > stl_parts_list.txt 

Thats it
